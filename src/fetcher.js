// The Python worker's network, for the requests it makes in batches.
//
// The Python worker cannot await anything during a run: yamc's downloader is
// blocking Rust, so its requests used to be synchronous XMLHttpRequests made
// one after another, a round trip each. When the downloader has a batch of
// independent requests it hands all of them to this worker and blocks on
// `Atomics.wait`; this worker fetches them concurrently with ordinary async
// fetch(), writes each answer into shared memory, and wakes it.
//
// Message, Python worker to this worker:
//   { requests: [[url, range], ...], ctl, arena, dataOrigin }
// `ctl` is an Int32Array on a SharedArrayBuffer: ctl[0] counts the requests
// answered, and request i's status, offset and length are at 1 + 3i. `arena`
// is a growable SharedArrayBuffer the bodies are appended to. Status 0 means
// the request did not complete. Each answer is also reported to the page, on
// the port it handed over at start, as a `fetch` message.

const PUBLISHED_ORIGIN = "https://yamc-data.xsplot.com/";
// Requests in flight at once. The data origin speaks HTTP/2, so they share
// one connection, and a ranged request costs its round trip rather than its
// bytes: yani-online measured the same closure at 38 s with 12 in flight and
// 21 s with 48.
